# Credit Risk Analysis
The purpose of this model was to determine if a loan would be considered a healthy loan or a high-risk loan.

- The accuracy score was 99%, this is a prime example of overfitting or highly skewed data
- The recall score was also at 99%, this indicates that the model correctly identifies a majority of the positive data
- The precision score was 100%, this shows that the model will predict the correct label every single time. This can also be another indicator that the model is overfit

In short, I would not recommend this model for use in identifying the risk factor of loans. The model is greatly overfit and may overgeneralize a large portion of the data fed into it.
